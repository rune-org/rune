# Quick Start

Build and run your first workflow in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure Rune is installed and running. If not, follow the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started).

## Step 1: Sign In

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Sign in with your admin credentials (or the account created during first-time setup)

## Step 2: Create a New Workflow

1. Click **"Workflows"** in the sidebar
2. Click the **"Create Workflow"** button
3. Give it a name like **"My First Workflow"**
4. You'll be taken to the visual workflow canvas

## Step 3: Add a Manual Trigger

Every workflow needs a **trigger node** — the entry point that starts execution.

1. The canvas opens with the node panel on the left
2. Drag a **Manual Trigger** node onto the canvas
3. This trigger starts the workflow when you click "Run"

## Step 4: Add an HTTP Request Node

Let's fetch data from a public API:

1. Drag an **HTTP** node onto the canvas
2. **Connect** the trigger to the HTTP node by dragging from the trigger's output handle to the HTTP node's input handle
3. Click the HTTP node to configure it:
   - **Method**: `GET`
   - **URL**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1`
4. Save the node configuration

## Step 5: Add a Conditional Node

Let's add a decision based on the HTTP response:

1. Drag a **Conditional** node onto the canvas
2. Connect the HTTP node's output to the Conditional node
3. Configure the expression:
   ```
   $Fetch User.status == 200
   ```
   This checks if the HTTP request returned a 200 status code.

The conditional node creates two output paths: **true** (success) and **false** (failure).

## Step 6: Add an SMTP Node (Optional)

If you have SMTP credentials configured, you can send an email on success:

1. Drag an **SMTP** node onto the canvas
2. Connect it to the **true** output of the conditional node
3. Configure:
   - **To**: `your-email@example.com`
   - **Subject**: `Workflow Result`
   - **Body**: `User data fetched successfully`
4. Assign your SMTP credential to the node

## Step 7: Run the Workflow

1. Click the **"Run"** button in the toolbar
2. Watch the nodes execute in real time — each node highlights as it runs:
   - 🔵 **Running** — currently executing
   - 🟢 **Success** — completed successfully
   - 🔴 **Failed** — encountered an error
   - ⏳ **Waiting** — paused (wait nodes)
3. Click any executed node to inspect its **input** and **output** data

## Step 8: Monitor the Execution

Navigate to the **Executions** page to see:
- Execution status (completed, failed, halted)
- Per-node status and timing
- Full input/output data for each node
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Understanding Data Flow

Data flows between nodes through an **accumulated context**. Each node's output is stored with a key based on the node name:

```javascript
// After the HTTP node "Fetch User" runs, its output is accessible as:
$Fetch User.status        // 200
$Fetch User.body.name     // "Leanne Graham"
$Fetch User.body.email    // "Sincere@april.biz"
$Fetch User.duration_ms   // 142
```

Downstream nodes can reference any previous node's output using the `$NodeName.field` syntax.

## Example: Complete API-to-Email Workflow

Here's the full flow of what we built:

```
Manual Trigger
    ↓
HTTP Request (GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1)
    ↓
Conditional ($Fetch User.status == 200)
    ├── true → SMTP (Send success email)
    └── false → (workflow ends)
```

## Error Handling

Each node supports three error handling strategies:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Halt** (default) | Stop the entire workflow on error |
| **Ignore** | Skip the error and continue to the next node |
| **Branch** | Follow a dedicated error edge to an error-handling node |

You can configure error handling in each node's settings panel.
